# Background
The risk management team at Alphabet Soup, a venture capital firm, receives many funding applications from startups every day. This team needs help creating a model that predicts whether applicants will be successful if funded by Alphabet Soup.

The business team has provided a CSV file containing more than 34,000 organizations that have received funding from Alphabet Soup over the years. The CSV file contains a variety of information about each business, including whether or not it ultimately became successful. Using machine learning and neural networks, utilize the features in the provided dataset to create a binary classifier model that will predict whether an applicant will become a successful business.

# What You're Creating
To prediction tool as to whether a funding applicants will be successful.

We'll use teh following: 
+ Preprocess data for a neural network model.
+ Use the model-fit-predict pattern to compile and evaluate a binary classification model.
+ Optimize the model.

# Requirements
+ pandas
+ tensorflow
+ pathlib
